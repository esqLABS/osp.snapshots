# osp.snapshots: Import and Manipulate Open Systems Pharmacology Project Snapshots

Provides a convenient R interface for working with PKSIM project
snapshots exported as JSON files. You provide the snapshot file, and
'osp.snapshots' handles the complex nested structure, allowing you to
easily import, navigate, modify, and export snapshot data. Building
blocks can be converted to data frames for integration with the
'ospsuite' R framework and broader R ecosystem.
