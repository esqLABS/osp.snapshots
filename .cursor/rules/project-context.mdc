# Objective
This project aims to create a convenient R interface for ospsuite project snapshots.

# Context
PKSIM project snapshot are json files exported from the PKSIM software.
User want to also be able to interact with these snapshot programatically through R.
However, due to their nested structure, they are not easy to interact with.
Thus, this project aims to make these snapshots more interoperable with the ospsuite R framework.

# Main Features
This package should be able to:

- Read and import all data in snapshot files
- Conveniently represent snapshot structure and content
- Convert parts of the snapshot to dataframe
- Export the snapshot representation back to snapshot file


# Technical Stack
- This project is an R package
- Any class should be created with the R6 package
- Everything should be documented using roxygen2 and tested using testthat packages
- All debug, info, warning and stop messages should be generated using the cli package
