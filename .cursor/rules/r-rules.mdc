This is an R project.

# Coding rules
  - Add comments when the code is not self explanatory
  - Write user feedback info and warning messages when appropriate (using the cli package)
  - In functions, check arguments provided by users
  - Anticipate and handle errors

# Never edit these files
  - README.md 
  - NAMESPACE or files inside man/ folder
  - docs/ folder

# Tests
  - Always implement or update tests when adding new functions or modify logic in existing function.
  - Always run "devtools::load_all()" before running tests (in the same call).
  - Use as much testthat::expect_equal() as possible to check test outputs.
